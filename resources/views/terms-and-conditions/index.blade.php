                          Certificate.

                      <h3 class="mt-2">Booking Confirmation:</h3>
                      <p>No booking is confirmed without the required deposit. Principals reserve the right to increase
                          prices

                          charges. They are responsible for checking and advising if anything is missing or incorrect.</p>

                      <h3 class="mt-2">Passport, Visas, and Health Requirements:</h3>
                      <p>Clients are responsible for checking and carrying correct passports, visas, and documents required

                          airlines, authorities, or countries. Check health requirements with a doctor before departure.</p>

                      <h3 class="mt-2">Special Requests and Medical Problems:</h3>
                      <p>Special requests are not guaranteed. Clients must advise in writing of any medical problems or

                          terminate arrangements if a client's behavior causes distress, danger, or annoyance. No refunds
                          will
                          be provided.</p>

                      <h3 class="mt-2">Force Majeure:</h3>
                      <p>The Company is not liable for loss, damage, delays, or changes arising from unforeseeable
                          circumstances
                          beyond control, such as war, industrial disputes, terrorist activity, natural disasters, technical
                          problems, or adverse weather conditions.</p>

                          liable
                          for additional costs due to the failure to reconfirm flights or schedule changes.</p>
