            Safa Travel's Umrah Packages 2026 can help you start your holy trip.
        </h3>
        <p>Every Muslim wants to undertake Umrah, and it's a huge step in their faith. There are only specified times
            when you can do Hajj once a year. You can do Umrah whenever you choose, and it will improve you spiritually
            in many ways. It purifies your soul, gets you closer to Allah, and helps you ask for forgiveness at the
            holiest places.</p>

        <p>At Safa Travel, we know that Umrah is more than just a trip; it's a journey of faith. We aim to make sure
            that every part of your Umrah 2026 pilgrimage is comfortable, convenient, and full of devotion. If this is
            your first time undertaking Umrah or if you're going back for the second time. We carefully plan our
            packages to meet your needs and provide you an experience you'll remember for the rest of your life.</p>

                    When to Book Your Umrah 2026 Package
                </h3>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">Winter Months (November to Mid-February)
                </h5>
                <p>The best time to do Umrah, is in the winter in Makkah and Madinah. The weather will be great, and it
                    will be
                    easier to do the rituals without getting too tired and too hot. Also, there will be less people at
                    the holy
                    sites, which will allow for you to focus more on your worship.</p>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">April and October as Shoulder Seasons</h5>
                <p>These months serve as the shoulder season for Umrah as the weather is good, and the number of
                    worshipers is
                    manageable. not too many people compared to very busy times like the Ramadan or summer, and these
                    months
                    will also usually be cheaper.</p>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">Ramadan (from Mid-February to April)</h5>
                <p>The rewards for Umrah in the holy month of Ramadan are astronomical. Do keep in mind, that this is
                    the
                    busiest time for Umrah with millions of worshipers going to Makkah and Madinah. You need to book
                    your Umrah
                    package well in advance to get the best priced flights and places to stay.</p>

                    Preparation for Your Umrah Pilgrimage 2026
                </h3>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">Spiritual Preparation</h5>
                <p>Before embarking on Umrah pilgrimage, it is wise to prepare your hearts and minds first. It is a good
                    idea to
                    learn the steps of Umrah and rituals, so you will know how to properly perform them. Likewise, it is
                    great
                    to have some time to reflect on your intentions and to make sincere resolve to obtain Allahâ€™s
                    forgiveness
                    and blessing during your pilgrimage.</p>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">Documentation and Travel</h5>
                <p>Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months from your departure date. An Umrah visa is
                    required,
                    and you are also required to have your meningitis shot to enter into Saudi Arabia. We will be
                    assisting your
                    preparation for all of documentation, so you will not have to worry about it.</p>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">Packing Essentials</h5>
                <p>Here is a packing list in preparation for your Umrah journey.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ihram clothing. Two ihram clothing sets for men. Loose, modest clothing for women.</li>
                    <li>Siddies Sandal comfortable footwear. Light sandals or slip-on shoes are recommended while
                        walking during
                        Tawaf and Saâ€™i.</li>
                    <li>Keep in mind, Makkah and Madinah can become very warm during the day, but can be cold at night.
                        Bring
                        clothes to keep you comfortable during both day and night.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 style="color:#008f7e; font-weight:700; margin-top:1rem;">Respect for Culture</h5>
                <p>Saudi Arabia has strict customs and regulations, so itâ€™s important to respect local traditions during
                    your
                    pilgrimage. Dress modestly, especially when visiting the holy sites. Women should wear an abaya, and
                    men
                    should avoid tight or brightly colored clothing. Never take photographs at sacred locations unless
                    explicitly permitted.</p>
